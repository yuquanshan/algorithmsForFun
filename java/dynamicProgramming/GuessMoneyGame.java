/** We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
*
* I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
* Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
*
* However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. 
* You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
*
* Example:
* n = 10, I pick 8.
* 
* First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
* Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
* Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
* 
* Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
* 
* You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
* Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
