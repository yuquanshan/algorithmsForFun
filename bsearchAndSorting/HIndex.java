/** Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) 
* of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
* 
* According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has 
* index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and 
* the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
*
* For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher 
* has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations 
* respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations 
* each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.
* 
* Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
* (there is an array-based O(n) algorithm which is better than my original binary search algorithm
* h index is the index where the number of paper whose citation is higher or equal than the value of 
* that index)
